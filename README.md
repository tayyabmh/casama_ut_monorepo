# Casama Web3 User Testing Platform

## Overview
Welcome to the primary product repository of Casama, a pioneering Web3 user testing platform that gained substantial traction. This repository encompasses both the frontend and backend of the platform, reflecting our journey from using Airtable as a quick-start backend solution to a more robust, scalable system.

Our platform empowered users to authenticate using a Soulbound token implementation (hosted in a separate repository), enabling them to engage with various opportunities, earn money, and build their reputation within the ecosystem.

## Features
